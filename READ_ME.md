%%%% BCDM problem solution using CVX Library

1. Details can be found in paper: 
Aniket Roy, Rajat Subhra Chakraborty: "Optimal Distortion Estimation for Prediction Error Expansion Based Reversible Watermarking." IWDW 2016: 265-279.

2. run my_code_1.m for each image.

3. Need to setup CVX library as follows.
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%steps for cvx setup
% 1. cd C:\personal\cvx-w64\cvx  %%% setup the path in which CVX exists
% 2. cvx_setup
% 3. then run this code
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% Steps:
% 1. Read the image
% 2. Create error histogram using DCT distribution
% 3. Convex optimization based threshold finding
% 4. Distortion calculation for given embedding capacity
% 5. Plot bpp vs. PSNR.

CVX Warning:
   Models involving "entr" or other functions in the log, exp, and entropy
   family are solved using an experimental successive approximation method.
   This method is slower and less reliable than the method CVX employs for
   other models. Please see the section of the user's guide entitled
       The successive approximation method
   for more details about the approach, and for instructions on how to
   suppress this warning message in the future.
   subject to
      L <= (N - c)/N;
cvx_end
 
Successive approximation method to be employed.
   For improved efficiency, SDPT3 is solving the dual problem.
   SDPT3 will be called several times to refine the solution.
